abstract: |
 In a context of growing concern for replicability, transparency, and access to science, we proposed to describe the levels of knowledge, belief, and practices of open science in the academic community of the social sciences in Chile. We conducted an exploratorty mixed-method design. The qualitative study consisted of semi-structured interviews with 14 academics, which were analyzed by performing a thematic analysis. The quantitative research consisted of a descriptive analysis (N=98). The questionnaire addressed issues about Open Science, transparent design, open data, and reproducible research. Overall, both studies pointed to low levels of knowledge and practices related to open science. In addition, despite generally positive attitudes, we noted particular concerns associated with the possibility of applying these principles in qualitative research, their perceived contradiction with the imperatives of academic productivity, and suspicions regarding researchers’ motivations. Thus, we identified important challenges for the implementation of open science initiatives in the social sciences in Chile, mainly their tension with public funding policies for social research and with the traditional principles of qualitative research.
