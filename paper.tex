\begin{abstract}
In a context of growing concern for replicability, transparency, and
access to science, we proposed to describe the levels of knowledge,
belief, and practices of open science in the academic community of the
social sciences in Chile. We conducted an exploratorty mixed-method
design. The qualitative study consisted of semi-structured interviews
with 14 academics, which were analyzed by performing a thematic
analysis. The quantitative research consisted of a descriptive analysis
(N=98). The questionnaire addressed issues about Open Science,
transparent design, open data, and reproducible research. Overall, both
studies pointed to low levels of knowledge and practices related to open
science. In addition, despite generally positive attitudes, we noted
particular concerns associated with the possibility of applying these
principles in qualitative research, their perceived contradiction with
the imperatives of academic productivity, and suspicions regarding
researchers' motivations. Thus, we identified important challenges for
the implementation of open science initiatives in the social sciences in
Chile, mainly their tension with public funding policies for social
research and with the traditional principles of qualitative research.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Over the past few years, academia has experienced a number of challenges
related to the concept of openness, which can be described in two main
aspects. The first one refers to the so-called \emph{replication crisis}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-baker_1500_2016}{Baker 2016};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-nosek_promoting_2015}{Nosek et al. 2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-peng_reproducibility_2015}{Peng 2015}), referring
to the difficulties in replicating research results due the lack of
transparency in the research process, evidencing important variations in
results in studies with identical data
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-breznau_does_2021}{Breznau 2021}). This has
resulted not only in the failure to replicate many published findings,
but also in the discovery and reporting of false data and results
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chopik_relationship_2020}{Chopik et al. 2020})
in order to publishing in high impact journals.

The second main aspect comes from openness in terms of access, whereby
several academic communities have reacted against the high payment
barriers and the business model imposed by publishing houses to access
the products of scientific research: universities pay a subscription to
access the work even of their own researchers and the general public
must pay again to obtains products funded by their taxes. One of the
most commented reactions has been the cancellation of subscriptions to
Elsevier's journals by prestige universities such as UCLA, which was
subsequently resolved through an agreement based on the adoption and
promotion of open-access practices.

Barriers to transparency and access are symptoms of an academic culture
driven by the publication of indicators that are biased towards
statistically significant results (p-hacking), leading to a tendency to
force results, even going as far as manipulating and falsifying data to
confirm proposed hypotheses
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-head_extent_2015}{Head et al. 2015}),
establishing ad hoc hyphotesis after knowing the results of a study
(HARKing) (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hollenbeck_harking_2017}{Hollenbeck
and Wright 2017}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-kerr_harking_1998}{Kerr 1998}).
As a result, the main audience for science is ultimately the editors of
high-impact journals, while other audiences -- such as civil society,
decision-makers and citizens --- are left out.

A growing number of initiatives around the world are addressing issues
of reproducibility, transparency, and access in science, such as the
Center for Open Science (COS), the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency
in Social Sciences (BITSS), and the Teaching Integrity in Empirical
Research (TIER) project. These initiatives promote openness at various
stages of the research process, such as transparency of research designs
through preregistration of studies, reproducibilty of analyses and data
manipulation, and publication of preprints without paywalls. Many of
these practices have been adopted by journals as recommendations or even
requirements for publication, as well as promoted by governmental
scientific institutions. All of this implies a major change in the way
science is conceived, practiced, and taught. Moreover, it seems to be a
necessary step to make science more relevant and closer to those outside
of academia. In other words, it would be difficult to improve openness
and exchange with local communities if the work within academia is
mostly closed and non-collaborative.

Like many others developments in science, the open science movement has
arrived slowly to Latin America, especially in social sciences. Although
there have been some initiatives in recent years (such as the Open
Science and Citizen Congress in Argentina 2018 or the OpenCon Latam in
Colombia 2019), most of them are driven mainly by the natural sciences.
In this line, Chile's National Agency for Research and Development
(ANID) has implemented since 2021 and \textbf{Open Access Policy for
scientific information and research data}, which aims to establish a
standard of public access to research products that have been funded by
ANID --- including social sciences projects. Therefore it is of
strategic nature to develop initiatives that aim to contribute to the
openness of sciences.

Based on this diagnosis, we aimed to identify the knowledge, attitudes
and practices of open science among social science academics in Chile.
From this analysis, we expect to generate debate and proposal for both
academic work and science policies.

\hypertarget{design}{%
\section{Design}\label{design}}

We conducted a mixed sequential-exploratory design. This approach
consist of two-stage method, usually starting with a qualitative
analysis followed by the development of quantitative instrument
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-creswell_designing_2018}{Creswell and Plano
Clark 2018}).

The integration of both techniques is justified by the fact that,
although there is international experience in the study of practices and
evaluation of Open Science, no previous research was found to address
this issue among Chilean social science academics. Thus, we proposed a
design that includes a first phase of qualitative exploration that
allowed us to have a first impression of the knowledge, practices and
attitudes about the concept of Open Science in the Chilean academic
community. The result of this first study were integrated in the design
of the quantitative instrument that was applied in a second study.

In addition to informing the construction of the instrument, the
integration between the qualitative and quantitative studies was
achieved by synthesizing the results of both phases. In this way, we
sought to draw coherent conclusions by evaluating how the quantitative
data were able to expand or validate the initial findings of the
qualitative study, generating a comprehensive understanding of the state
of Open Science in the Chilean social sciences.

\section{Qualitative Study}\label{qualitative-study}}

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}}

We conducted a total of 13 semi-structured interviews with empirical
social science researchers, who were selected through a simple random
sampling method based on predetermined criteria. The sampling frame
considered all academics who had been granted with a Regular Fondecyt
(National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development) Project
between 2018 and 2019 in the following study groups: Anthropology and
Archaeology, Economic and Administrative Sciences, Legal and Political
Sciences, Psychology, and Sociology.

To ensure a diverse sample, we allocated quotas based on sex and study
group, randomly selecting one or two informants per sex for each study
group. Researchers primarily engaged in theoretical research, those
specializing in philosophical research within Legal and Political
Science study group, those not dedicated to social anthropology within
the Anthropology and Archaeology study group, and those focused on
neuroscience within the Psychology study group, were excluded from the
sample. Finally, given the multidisciplinary composition of the
sociology study group --- which includes researchers from related
fields, such as social psychology and social work --- we employed a
randomization process to ensure the inclusion of at least one
sociologist. The final composition of the sample is presented in
Table~\ref{tbl-qual-sample}

Despite it was not considered as a sample inclusion criterion, the
participants mirror the methodological diversity observed in the social
sciences in Chile (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ramos_campo_2008}{Ramos,
Canales, and Palestini 2008}). Specifically, six researchers
predominantly utilize qualitative methods, five predominantly work with
quantitative methods, and two use mixed methods.

The interviews were conducted via video call, with a duration ranging
from forty minutes to one hour. We addressed topics such as researchers'
familiarity and knowledge about open science, their engagement in open
science practice, their attitudes of openness and transparency
practices, and the potential compulsory use of these practices in the
future.

We employed a qualitative thematic analysis, as is a method that
facilitates the identification and description of patterns of meanings
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-braun_using_2006}{Braun and Clarke 2006}), as
well as the set of relationships and hierarchies that are generated
between them, organized around the concept of open science and the ideas
associated with it, based on both semantic and latent codes
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-boyatzis_transforming_2010}{Boyatzis 2010}). In
this sense, this method is particularly useful for understanding
participants' views, knowledge, experiences, and values regarding open
science.

Two research team members conducted primarily the analysis, with support
from ATLAS.ti qualitative analysis software version 9.0.5. The coding
process was carried out simultaneously by both researchers and discussed
in regular team meetings. This approach ensured triangulation throughout
the analysis process
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-nowell_thematic_2017}{Nowell et al. 2017}). In
addition, versions of the project and its products were systematically
archived, and the researchers' personal reflection and team discussions
about the analysis were recorded in a reflective diary, in order to
safeguard the auditability of the research process
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lewins_using_2007}{Lewins and Silver 2007}).

Throughout the results report, we will reference specific participants
in parentheses, indicating their discipline and their predominant
methodological approach. For example, we will use tags such as
\emph{Sociology, mixed-methods} or \emph{Economics, quantitative}.

\hypertarget{open-science-a-fuzzy-concept}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Open Science: A fuzzy
concept}}{Open Science: A fuzzy concept}}\label{open-science-a-fuzzy-concept}}

Initially, the concept of open science seems to be a difficult idea to
define, seemingly distant to the participants. Most interviewees
indicated that they were unfamiliar with the idea of open science and
did not associate it with concrete practices or initiatives. However,
this coexist with varying degrees of awareness of the problems faced,
common practices of openness and transparency, and even experiences of
researchers who have been directly involved in a number of institutional
or international open science initiatives.

Rather than referring to concrete open science practices, the concept is
mainly associated with a variety of research initiatives and policy
orientations. It is strongly associated with community engagement or
scientific dissemination, as well as with access of the general
population or ``communities'' to research results.

Some interviewees also associate the concept with knowledge production,
referring to the involvement of participants, communities and
stakeholders in the research process; the use mixed (Sociology,
qualitative); or interdisciplinary (Anthropology, qualitative;
Sociology, qualitative) methods. Few refer to practices such as open
data or publication in open access journals.

Despite the difficulties in defining it, we observed mostly positive
attitudes about open science, at least in the first instance. These
range from it direct association with democratic values and knowledge
democratization, to more vague and doubtful assessments. However, some
negative perceptions have also been observed, with some researchers
referring to open science as a ``fever'' --- i.e.~a passing trend --- or
as an ``overly ambitions project''.

\hypertarget{open-science-attitudes-and-practices}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Open Science attitudes and
practices}}{Open Science attitudes and practices}}\label{open-science-attitudes-and-practices}}

\hypertarget{a.-open-results}{%
\paragraph{a. Open Results}\label{a.-open-results}}

In the interviews, the idea of openness is fundamentally linked to the
openness of results. There is a consensus to prioritize this practices,
either through open access journals, policies such as the Gold Route
(Pyshcology, quantitative; Anthropology; qualitative), or by sharing
preprints and final versions in academic or personal social media.

Regarding the initiative of sharing and requesting articles or previous
versions in academic social media, two main attitudes stand out among
researchers. On the one hand, there is an attitude of suspicion towards
this type of practices, considering it a mixture of altruism and
personal interest (Psychology, quantitative). Although scientific
collaboration is valued and desirable, it is recognized that it benefits
the researcher by increasing the number of citations. This suspicion of
an instrumental motivation, linked to funding policies, leads some
researchers to refrain from these practices.

On the other hand, we found that the existence of non-dissemination
clauses in many journals discourage the sharing of results, although no
researcher reported being sanctioned or audited for sharing their
publications. Beyond any concern, the high value placed on the openness
of results encourage researchers to share their publications in
academics social media or other platforms.

To facilitate access to the results of their projects, some researchers
have resorted to legal means such as the Gold Route. This alternative
allows free access to publications against payment by the authors.
However, this option is viewed negatively by some respondents, who have
expressed their refusal to pay for this service again in the future due
recent increases in fees (Psychology, quantitative; Anthropology,
qualitative).

In light of this, it is questioned whether these initiative truly
reflect the principles of open science, criticizing the role and market
power of large publishers. It is argued that these practices are based
on shifting the cost of access from users to researchers (Psychology,
quantitative). However, these views coexist with a more pragmatic
perspective that recognize that, given the model is based on free peer
preview and sale of access, someone must assume the cost of openness
(Political Science, mixed-methods).

On the other hand, it is possible to identify a generally negative
attitude towards ANID's dissemination policy, as it is perceived as
inadequate for the dissemination of knowledge produced with public
funds. Interviewees report the rigidity of the policy to the extent that
it makes it difficult to carry out certain dissemination initiatives
aimed at non-academic audiences, such as the publications of podcasts.

In addition, it is highlighted that ANID's funding structure places a
greater emphasis in WoS and Scopus indexed journals, to detriment of
Spanish-language OA journals. Although the latter have less academic
impact, it is recognized that they are more accessible to the general
public and decision-makers.

On the contrary, the prioritization of English-language paywalled
journals is perceived as a ``transfer of capital from the global South
to the global North'' (anthropology, qualitative). In this way, research
funded with public resources is published in paywalled journals to which
national researchers or their universities must pay --- usually with
public funds --- in order to gain access.

Thus, interviewees identify tensions between the need to open and
disseminate the results of publicly funded research, the rigidity of
ANID's dissemination policy, and its funding and incentive scheme. In
order to balance the pressure to publish in high-impact journals with
the principles of openness, researchers have adopted strategies such as
diversifying their research outputs. On of them is the ``sacrifice of
publications'', which implies deferring results: some are sent to high
impact journals in order to maximize scores in future funding
applications; others are sent to local open journals in Spanish, which
are more accessible to the general public. The following quote
illustrates this practices and its effects:

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, leftrule=.75mm, opacityback=0, breakable, rightrule=.15mm, left=2mm, colback=white, arc=.35mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toprule=.15mm]

{[}\ldots{]} we published in a journal which is\ldots{} I think it is
only SciELO {[}\ldots{]} I have published much better things, let's say,
in better journals than that one, and I have never been called by the
Ministry {[}\ldots{]} And for this article they called us, they asked us
for an interview, just yesterday we had to make a presentation for all
the teams working on the topic we are researching. So {[}\ldots{]} it is
necessary to make that effort to, sometimes, sacrifice, in quotation
marks, some data and publish them in journals with lower indexation,
because in the end those are the ones that are disseminated more and
reach more where one\ldots{} or at least where I would expect them to
reach, which is where decisions can be made {[}\ldots{]} (Psychology,
quantitative)

\end{tcolorbox}

In line with the previous quote, is is noted that the idea of openness
is not limited to access to academic publications, but that the results
must have ``social impact''. With this in mind, practices such as the
publications of columns and editorial in written press (Psychology,
quantitative), the creation of documentaries (Sociology, qualitative),
and instances of feedback with the communities that participated in the
study (Anthropology, qualitative; Psychology, quantitative) are adopted.

Finally, with regard to access to scientific publications, the
interviewees emphasized the role played by the universities where they
work, specially through their libraries. For this reason, respondents
indicated that they had not experienced difficulties in accessing
publications. On the other hand, others recognize that in Latin America
the practice of accessing scientific products such as preprints or
working papers though informal mechanisms or even piracy is widespread
among researchers and provides yet another mean of dealing with access
problems without major consequences.

\hypertarget{b.-design-transparency}{%
\paragraph{b. Design Transparency}\label{b.-design-transparency}}

Only a few respondents reported having pre-registered their research on
the Open Science Framework website (Psychology, quantitative; Political
Science, mixed-methods) or though journal initiatives (Political
Science, mixed-methods; Economics, quantitative). In the case of
economics, it is noted that pre-registration is a widespread practice
given the protocols of the American Economics Association. These have
been evaluated positively, but in some cases they are considered as an
excessive standard due to its obligatory nature in many journals. All
this experiences seem to point to the importance of editorial initiative
in promoting transparency practices in the research process.

However, the vast majority of respondents were not really familiar with
the concept of pre-registration. Another group of respondents were aware
of the idea, but without practicing it, and outlined various arguments
against it, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The idea that pre-registration is only possible in certain types of
  research --- quantitative research with hypothesis --- so its practice
  does not make sense in other designs (Psychology, qualitative;
  Economics; quantitative).
\item
  It is argued that pre-registration can be a ``straitjacket''
  (Political Science, qualitative), especially in the case of following
  a more inductive logic. For some researchers, the design exists only
  in its execution (Sociology, qualitative), so equivalence between an
  earlier design and the final product cannot be guaranteed.
\item
  There are concerns about intellectual property rights when publishing
  research designs that have not yet been carried out (Psychology,
  quantitative).
\end{itemize}

In sum, despite highlighting the fact that the pre-registration of
hypotheses make it possible to ensure that a research does not involve
practices such as HARKing, the low knowledge and training in this
practice, its association with certain types of research, the
methodological limitations raised, and the concerns related to
intellectual property are the bases of the suspicion and consequent low
extent of this practice.

\hypertarget{c.-open-data}{%
\paragraph{c.~Open Data}\label{c.-open-data}}

Positive attitudes towards open data are mainly based on the belief that
it is useful for the development of science. This is because it is
understood to enhance the scientific impact of publications associated
with the data, to save human and financial resources allocated to data
production, and to reduce the impact on marginalized communities or
social groups that are more often studied.

Particularly in the case of publicly funded research, most researchers
showed a very positive attitude towards data openness, and several
pointed out that it should be a stronger or mandatory requirement. Some
researchers even argued that data in this type of research are public
goods, and non-availability of data was perceived as illegitimate
hoarding.

On the other hand, some researchers question the obligation of data
openness, highlighting the personal investment and additional cost
involved. They argue that data are research property, at least
temporarily, since their production requires innovation, creativity, and
the building of relationship with subjects or institutions. For these
researchers, data production is therefore an intellectual production,
not a simple investment of public resources executed by the researcher.

In addition, there is a tension between open data and the pressure to
publish, not only because of the time the researcher must devote to
opening data, but also because of the pressure for scientific products
with original and novel questions and designs. Thus some researchers
question the value of open data, arguing that it is difficult to use
public data in new ways because it has already been used.

Along with this suspicion about the usefulness of open data, we observed
doubts about whether this practice is suited to the specificity of
social science research. Thus, respondents pointed to the methodological
costs and ethical risk that researchers perceive in practice, drawing a
distinction between quantitative and qualitative research.

On the one hand, all researchers agreed that most quantitative data
should not require special ethical protocols or conditions of use,
except for data generated in special populations or in economics studies
where the data belong to private companies.

On the other hand, the opening of qualitative data faces significant
challenges from the perspective of respondents, such as protecting the
identity of participants. It is mentioned that even if it were possible
to mobilize human resources for data anonymization, the risk of harm to
many communities exceed their anonymity. In addition, the
decontextualization of the data due the loss of the relationship between
the researcher and the communities limits the analysis and discourages
its use.

It is noteworthy that despite the perceived differences in the ease and
relevance of openness between qualitative and quantitative data, only
two of the researchers interviewed --- one qualitative and one
quantitative --- had ever practiced open data publication beyond
editorial requirements and sharing data directly with other researchers.

\hypertarget{d.-analysis-transparency}{%
\paragraph{d.~Analysis Transparency}\label{d.-analysis-transparency}}

Analysis transparency is valued for its contribution to scientific
progress and to the methodological learning of new researchers. In
addition, a growing demand from high-impact journals for more detailed
methodological sections in qualitative research and for the disclosure
of analysis codes in quantitative studies is perceived and appreciated.
This increased transparency is associated with greater analytical rigor
and validity of results.

Practices and expectations of transparency differ between qualitative
and quantitative research. In the former, transparency is mainly
associated with methodological clarity in publications, occasionally
supplemented by appendices detailing some procedures. However,
publication of input such as codebooks or software outputs are not a
priority for qualitative researchers, nor are expectation of
reproducibility.

The transparency of quantitative analysis tends to be associated with
the public or private availability of analysis codes developed. It is
noteworthy that in many cases this availability tends to be requested by
academic journals. Although it is not fully addressed, it is possible to
conclude that the greater use of software for these procedures, compared
to what happens in qualitative research, tends to facilitate the
consolidation of a set of practices and attitudes more favorable to the
transparency of analyses.

However, no researcher reported having openly published their analysis
code, as these are usually shared privately, through academic networks
or personal contacts. It is mentioned that the codes are like
``toothbrushes'' (Economics, quantitative), highly personal and not
designed for public sharing. In addition, ethical and methodological
complications, as well as the need for clarity and tidiness in the codes
for them in order to be useful, highlight the lack of a standard for
their publication. Finally, it is mentioned that in some disciplines,
such as economics, researchers have not migrate to open source software
due to the persistence of the widespread use of programs with payment
barriers.

The results of the Open Science in Social Research (CAIS) survey were
used as the basis for the quantitative study. Its questionnaire was
designed by our research team based on the literature review

as findings from the qualitative study.

The questionnaire consisted of 111 questions divided into the following
modules:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Academic Career}: 14 items to describe the academic career and
  participation in research projects of the respondents.
\item
  \textbf{General Aspects of Open Science}: 20 items about the level of
  knowledge of the participants about open science and the tools it
  provides.
\item
  \textbf{Research Practices, Openness and Ethics in Social Sciences:}
  14 items assessing the frequency with which the researchers perform
  certain practices, both positive and negative, related to the research
  process, as well as the perception of the frequency with which other
  researchers perform them.
\item
  \textbf{Open Data}: 17 items analyzing researchers' perceptions of the
  openness of data.
\item
  \textbf{Reproducible Research}: 15 items exploring researchers'
  perceptions and practices regarding the openness of analysis in their
  research.
\item
  \textbf{Open access to publication}: 16 items exploring researchers'
  perception and practices regarding open access to their research
  results.
\item
  \textbf{ANID Open Access Policy}: 10 items exploring researchers'
  knowledge of ANID's Open Access Policy for publicly funded scientific
  information and research data.
\item
  \textbf{Sociodemographic Characterization}: 5 item on the
  socio-demographic characteristic of the participants.
\end{enumerate}

We used FormR for the implementation of the questionnaire. FormR is an
open source software that allows the design of complex questionnaires
with a high degree of customization
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-arslan_chain_2025}{Arslan and Tata 2025};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-arslan_formr_2020}{Arslan, Walther, and Tata
2020}) . Since it is integrated with RStudio (R + RMarkdown), it
facilitates collaborative work regardless of the length of the
questionnaire. The platform allows the questionnaire to be
self-administered, either by personal computers or by smartphones.

To construct the sample, mass mailings were sent to researchers who had
received state research funding, to faculties and departments of various
social science disciplines, and to research centers and nuclei. In
addition, the survey was distributed through social media and at
academic events. In the end, 98 complete responses were received. The
description of the sample is presented in Table~\ref{tbl-resumen}.

We conducted a descriptive uni- and bivariate analysis of the key
indicators of the questionnaire. We aimed to describe the respondents'
knowledge, practices and attitudes about open science and the constructs
described above. These variable were crossed by age group, research
focus, academic career stage, academic degree, and gender to detect
possible differences between groups.

\hypertarget{results-1}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results-1}}

\hypertarget{knowledge}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Knowledge}}{Knowledge}}\label{knowledge}}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig-cca}, the concept most recognized by the
respondents is open access to publications (79\%), in line with what was
described in the qualitative study. Ideas such as open data (59\%), the
use of free software for analysis (53\%), and the concept of open
science itself (46\%) have medium levels of knowledge among respondents.
At the other extreme, only 25\% of respondents say they are familiar
with the pre-registration of hypotheses.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{paper_files/figure-pdf/fig-cca-1.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-cca}Familiarity with Open Science concepts}

\end{figure}

In general, knowledge levels seem to be higher among young researchers
and with a predominantly quantitative focus, as shown in the
Figure~\ref{fig-cca-grid}. Respondents between 28 and 34 years of age,
thus, show higher levels of knowledge about free software, and the
concepts of reproducible research and open science
(Figure~\ref{fig-cca-grid-1}). However, researchers between 35 and 49
years of age show higher levels of knowledge of hypotheses
preregistration and open access to data. Quantitative researchers,
meanwhile, show higher levels of knowledge of all concepts except open
access to publications (Figure~\ref{fig-cca-grid-2}).

\end{figure}

Similarly, ANID's Open Access to Scientific Information and Research
Data Policy shows a medium to low level of awareness. Specifically, only
half of the respondents have heard of ANID's policy. On the other hand,
only 26\% are aware of ANID's data management plan for the open access
policy.

\hypertarget{practices}{%
\subsubsection{Practices}\label{practices}}

\hypertarget{a.-own-practices-and-communitys-practices}{%
\paragraph{a. Own practices and Community's
practices}\label{a.-own-practices-and-communitys-practices}}

In general, the frequency of practices related to open science is low,
as seen in Figure~\ref{fig-prac}. 32\% of respondents always or almost
always use online repositories to upload information related to their
research, and 16\% report sharing code among researchers
(Figure~\ref{fig-prac-2}). These types of practices are more common
among male researchers, those whose primary research strategy is
quantitative, and those who are in an early stage in their academic
careers.

\begin{figure}

\subcaption{\label{fig-prac-2}Own Practices}
\end{minipage}%

\caption{\label{fig-prac}How often are the following practices
performed?}

\end{figure}

Interestingly, researchers generally report better practices for
themselves than for the community. For example, only 14\% believe that
the community always or almost always uses online repositories to upload
information related to their research, and 5\% believe that researchers
share code with that frequency (Figure~\ref{fig-prac-1}).

This gap also exits in the case of malpractice. 9\% of the respondents
say they almost always or always fail to report studies or variables
that do not reach statistical significance, while 45\% believe this
practices are that common in the community. On the other hand, while 7\%
say they selectively report results, 40\% believe it is always or almost
always done in the community. Finally, while no one admits to having
manipulated data to validate a hypothesis, 4\% say this always or almost
always happens in the community.

It is curious that when the analysis is broken down into different
groups, certain trends are repeated. Male, quantitative-oriented,
early-career researchers are at the same time those who declare the
highest frequency of own practices, both negative and positive, as well
as those perceive the highest number of negative practices in the
community. These differences can be seen in detail in the
Figure~\ref{fig-prac-grid}

\hypertarget{b.-open-science-barriers}{%
\paragraph{b. Open Science Barriers}\label{b.-open-science-barriers}}

There is a high perception of barriers to the development of Open
Science in all its dimensions. Lack of policy is perceived as the main
barrier in all dimensions, as can be seen in the
Figure~\ref{fig-barreras}. Lacks of knowledge also appears as a major
barrier especially for transparent design, open data and reproducible
research. Finally, lack of incentives is recognized as another aspect
that hinders data openness.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{paper_files/figure-pdf/fig-barreras-1.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-barreras}¿To what extent do you consider that the
following factors limit Open Science?}

\end{figure}

Regarding this last point, the incentives that researchers might have to
open their data were analyzed. As can be seen in the
Figure~\ref{fig-motivaciones}, networking, the dissemination of publicly
funded data to the community, and the increase of one's own visibility
are highly valued as incentives for open data.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{paper_files/figure-pdf/fig-motivaciones-1.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-motivaciones}Open data motivations}

\end{figure}

It is interesting to note that, as can be seen in the
Figure~\ref{fig-motivaciones-grid}, while the dissemination of results
is valued transversally, there are groups where the valuation of
extrinsic motivations has a greater preponderance. In particular,
networking and increasing one's own visibility are incentives more
highly valued by women (Figure~\ref{fig-motivaciones-grid-1}) and
researchers between 35 and 49 years of age
(Figure~\ref{fig-motivaciones-grid-2})

\hypertarget{a.-attitudes-on-open-science-measures}{%
\paragraph{a. Attitudes on Open Science
Measures}\label{a.-attitudes-on-open-science-measures}}

In general, the possibility of adopting Open Science measures in the
social sciences is assessed positively, as can be see in
Figure~\ref{fig-val}. Open access (92\%), replication of results (67\%),
reporting of non-statistically significant results (76\%), and online
availability of data and analysis materials (72\%) all show a high level
of acceptance among respondents. The only exception is the
pre-registration of hypothesis, which received a positive evaluation of
only 42\%. This is explained by a higher level of unfamiliarity (17\%
say they are not aware of the measure), in addition to the reluctance
already observed in the qualitative study.

by females researchers and by researchers with a quantitative approach,
as can be seen in the Figure~\ref{fig-vca-grid}

As shown in the Figure~\ref{fig-dona}, 39\% of respondents believe there
is a major replication crisis, while 40\% do not know if there is one.
Concern is greater among quantitative researchers, as seen in
Figure~\ref{fig-dona-grid}, with 70\% believing that the crisis is
important. While there is no denial of the crisis among qualitative
researchers, 60\% do not know if there is a crisis or not.

social science research is reproducible, as shown in
Table~\ref{tbl-tablaacum}

This is consistent with the 40\% of respondents having attempted to
reproduce the results of other researchers (Figure~\ref{fig-reprod-1}).
Of this percentage, only 20\% of the attempts were complete
reproductions, while 69\% were only partial (Figure~\ref{fig-reprod-2})

\paragraph{c.~Attidues about ANID's Open Science

In the first instance, ANID's Open Science Policy is well received by
the respondents. For example, 90\% agree or strongly agree that ANID
should continue to develop its Open Science Policy, as show in
Figure~\ref{fig-vanid-grid-2}. Similarly, 84\% consider the
implementation of Open Access policies to be quite or very necessary, as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-vanid-grid-1}

However, there are other practices that are less well received. Thus,
both mandatory pre-registration, as shown in

(Figure~\ref{fig-vanid-grid-b-2}), are supported only by half of the
respondents.

\hypertarget{low-knowledge-few-practices}{%
\subsection{Low knowledge, few
practices}\label{low-knowledge-few-practices}}

Both studies indicate a medium or low level of knowledge about the
concepts of open science and an even lower lever of practices. The
concept is mainly associated with the openness of results. Nevertheless,
the qualitative study points out that it is not only understood as
publication in open access journals, but also as other ways of engaging
with the community and generating impact, understood beyond the metrics
of academic journals.

This is also related to a series of practices aimed at openness and
transparency of research results. Thus, in the qualitative study it was
possible to observe accounts of experiences in open access publications,
use of the ``Gold Route'' and sharing articles or pre-prints through
social media or private platforms.

However, the level of knowledge and practices drops significantly for
concepts and measures related to transparent design, openness of data,
and transparency of analysis. In general, the quantitative study seems
to distinguish that there are groups of researchers who show higher
levels of knowledge and practices, particularly younger researchers and
those whose predominant research approach is quantitative.

This lack of knowledge is recognized as one of the main barriers to
implementing practices and policies that are consistent with open
science principles. However, practices related to design transparency
(such as pre-registration of hyphoteses), data openness (making data
public or sharing them with other researchers), or analysis transparency
(such as sharing analysis codes) encounter many more barriers and
reluctance on the part of researchers, as discussed below.

\hypertarget{positive-general-attitudes-particular-concerns}{%
\subsection{Positive general attitudes, particular
concerns}\label{positive-general-attitudes-particular-concerns}}

As a general concept, open science is viewed positively. It is
emphasized that its principles would allow better dissemination of
results withing the scientific community, while avoiding malpractices.
In addition, it would increase the possibility of generating impact
beyond academic metrics, making it easier for communities and
decision-makers to read the results. This is coupled with the awareness
that public research funding implies a certain responsibility to make
results and data available to academic and general public. Therefore, it
is not surprising that 90\% of the respondents are in favor of ANID
implementing open access policies.

However, once certain practices are explored, concerns about the
possibility and desirability of implementing open science measures
related to transparency of designs, openness of data, and transparency
of analysis begin to emerge. We identified three key issues:

First, the \textbf{difficulty of applying many of these measures in
qualitative research}. With the exception of openness of results, the
positive assessment of practices related to open science is higher among
researchers with a quantitative approach and lower among those who
practice predominantly qualitative approaches. This is line with what we
observed in the first study, where it was noted that the preregistration
and the openness of data generate important epistemological,
methodological, and ethical conflicts with the traditional principles of
qualitative research. Similarly, the replication crisis appears as a
much greater concern among quantitative researchers, in line with what
we observed in the first study, where reproducibility hardly appears on
the horizon of qualitative researchers.

Second, the \textbf{difficulty of reconciling the principles of open
science with the imperatives of academic productivity} imposes by
universities and public funding agencies. Even the openness of results,
the principle with the greatest legitimacy, must face the difficulty
that ANID's funding structure favors publication in journals with
payment barriers. On the other hand, measures such as pre-registration
and open data raise suspicious about the protection of researcher's
intellectual property and limit the originality and impact of potential
publications.

Finally, we noted \textbf{a reluctance with regard to the motivations}
behind the implementation of these measures. For some researchers, these
practices do no escape the criticized logic of dissemination and
funding. For example it is argued that sharing results and data brings
personal benefits through increases of citations, in line with the
demands of academic productivity.

In this sense, the quantitative study suggests that building networks
and improving one's visibility are among the main motivations for
opening data, especially among female researchers and those with
intermediate academic career. Beyond any moral judgment about the
motivations of those researchers, it would be interesting to investigate
why there are specific groups that would be more inclined to adopt open
sciences practices for extrinsic motivations.

\hypertarget{critical-assessment-of-anids-policies}{%
\subsection{Critical assessment of ANID's
policies}\label{critical-assessment-of-anids-policies}}

Both the qualitative and quantitative studies revealed a critical
perception of ANID's open access policies. In particular, we observed a
tension between the need for transparency and community impact of
publicly funded research, and ANID's funding scheme --- which favors
publication in journals that generally present payment barriers.

Researchers associate this with two problems. On the one hand, it is
perceived as limiting the real possibility of research impact,
distancing its results from communities and decision-makers. On the
other hand, it is pointed out that this system results in the use of
large amount of public funds to finance the business of large
first-world scientific publishers.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

The studies presented here show that for the social science community in
Chile, open science is fundamentally associated with open access to
research results, whether through open access journals or other forms of
dissemination. This is accompanied by a set of practices, a positive
assessment of these measures, and critical positions towards the
policies promoted by ANID. Nevertheless, other dimensions of open
science (as transparent design, open data and transparency of analysis)
show a lower level of knowledge, a lower frequency of practices and a
ambivalent evaluation.

However, we observed some differences between groups of researchers,
particularly with respect to research approach. For instance,
researchers with a quantitative approach reported a higher level of
knowledge, a greater number and frequency of practices, a greater
concern about replication crisis, and a higher appreciation of the
measures promoted by Open Science. Qualitative researchers, on the other
hand, showed greater reluctance, ranging from practical barriers to
epistemological concerns.

Age and gender appear to influence knowledge, practices and attitudes
towards open science. Future research could aim to formulate models that
explain difference in disposition towards open science, as well as
distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for accepting
this types of measures.

Taken together, both studies raise important challenges for open social
science in Chile. First, the need to review ANID's funding and
dissemination policies in other to better meet both the needs of
researchers and the principles of open science. Thus, the concerns
raised by the participants regarding the use of public resources are of
paramount importance and cannot be ignored.

Second, the studies highlight the need to bridge knowledge and incentive
gaps in order to allow greater openness to the application of open
sciences measures in all its dimensions. This implies opening spaces for
methodological and epistemological debate to overcome the reluctance
observed among some groups of researchers, particularly those with a
predominantly qualitative approach.
